The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. It is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L.\u00a0Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987 and after a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox. The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series. Two pinball machines have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and \"The Simpsons Pinball Party\" (2003). Additionally, several handheld device games have been released, such as \"Bartman: Avenger of Evil\" (1990) and \"Bart Simpson's Cupcake Crisis\" (1991).<t> The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History <\/t>The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History is a non-fiction book about the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\".

In the United Kingdom, the book is called Simpsons Confidential: The uncensored, totally unauthorised history of the world's greatest TV show by the people that made it. The book is an oral history of the show, and concentrates particularly on the writers and producers of the show. The book includes entire chapters devoted to key figures such as creator Matt Groening and James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, who helped develop the series. According to National Public Radio reviewer Linda Holmes, \"Ortved's thesis, essentially, is that lots of people are responsible for the success of \"The Simpsons\", and their creator, Matt Groening, has too often been viewed as the sole source to the detriment of others who also deserve to be praised.\"<t> List of The Simpsons guest stars <\/t>In addition to the show's regular cast of voice actors, celebrity guest stars have been a staple of \"The Simpsons\", an American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company, since its first season. \"The Simpsons\" focuses on the eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.
